        <p>
            This was a website that I had built for the Governor on short notice. This was a great learning experience using content management system because at the time of request and due to certain circumstances within the team,
            I had to learn everything to make the site in the content management system without prior training and to accommodate the needs of the governor in a very short amount of time and alone. Although this was made in a CMS
            I had to make some custom features that were not built out to accomodate for the Governor's requests.

        <!--Color Contrast Checker-->
        <h2>Webscraping Color Contrast Checker Tool</h2>
        <p>
            I had made a webscraping tool that pulled the color of elements and compared them to the background color (contrast) and exported the results into a spreadsheet.
            The reason I made this tool is because when it comes to ADA compliance this is normally checked manually, and at the time I had a list of websites that needed to pass these issues,
            so I made a tool that did it automatically. I wrote this application using Python at first and then I switched over to C#/.NET.

        <p>
            This website was built for the Nevada Gaming Commission and Nevada Gaming Control Board beacuse originally they were sites and information were not maintained by my team,
            but they wanted to be put into our stack. The site itself was built by other members of my team at the time, however as a group we migrated all of the content from the
            old site to the new one. Since Nevada Gaming Commission and Nevada Gaming Control Board is so important to the State of Nevada, my team and I were given awards for our
            hardwork and getting the job done exceptionally quick.

            This website was developed from scratch for personal use and for the public so that I can use it for job applications and to give a more accurate representation of skills,
            to an extent.
